# LinkedIn Cold Email Generator

This application generates personalized cold emails based on the job posting and your details. By entering your information and the URL of an open LinkedIn job posting, the app will generate a professional cold email that you can send to recruiters.

## Features

- **Personalized Email Generation**: Simply input your details and the URL of a LinkedIn job posting to receive a tailored cold email.
- **Smart Email Formatting**: The application intelligently formats emails based on job descriptions and your input, ensuring they are professional and concise.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses Langchain, OpenAI, and other tools to generate emails that align with job descriptions.

## Libraries Used

This project uses several powerful libraries to handle tasks like text processing, embeddings, and document retrieval:

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **Langchain**: To process job postings and generate contextually aware emails.
- **OpenAI**: To power the language model for generating personalized emails.
- **FAISS**: For fast similarity search over the generated embeddings.
- **dotenv**: To load environment variables like your OpenAI API key.
- **get_details**: A custom module to extract job posting details from LinkedIn.
